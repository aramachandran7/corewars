## What we did
* Built a RedCode (dialect of assembly used to play corewars) engine with an entirely javascript backend to proccess redcode commands and work directly with our entirely JS stack
* Built an interactive, modern user interface around the original game to drive a stronger, more intuitive UX
* Working with students to test & deploy as a learning tool
* Built with MERN stack: (Mongo Express React Node), using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
